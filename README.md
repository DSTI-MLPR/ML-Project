Predicting Diabetes Outcome for Women

â€¢ Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in women based on several health metrics. 
The model leverages a dataset of 15,000 women aged between 20 and 80, with data collected from the Taipei Municipal Medical Center between 2018 and 2022. 
The goal is to use various health-related features to predict whether a woman has diabetes, assisting healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention.
